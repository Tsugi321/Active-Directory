## Objective

The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned



### Tools Used

- VirtualBox as a vitual machine host
- Windows 10, Ubuntu server, Kali Linux, and Windows server 2022 as Operating systems
- Splunk is used as the SIEM

## Steps
1. Create a Network Diagram to plan out the structure of the lab environment
2. Download and install all necessary VM Systems
   2.5. Sudo apt-get update && Sudo apt-get upgrade -y on ubuntu server
3. Set up a NAT Network with planned IP address and connect all VMs to that network
4. Set up splunk using a shared directory
